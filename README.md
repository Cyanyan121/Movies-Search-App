## Concepts Covered

- Create an account and request an API key for [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Manage State with React useState Hook
- Use Props to communicate between parent and child components, relying on the top-down data flow instead of trying to sync the state between different components
- Use controlled components to control the actions that occur on the form during user input, making state the only data source
- Request and display movie data to The Movie Database API via Fetch API
